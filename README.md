# ADV-SOC-2023
As a member of ADV SOC Team I will be maintaining this repository which will contain solutions to the assignments and all the related content provided by the mentor
I am learning python and project related content in it.
I will start learning RL. As learning RL and Markov's Decision Process is task for Week2 and Week3.
As soon as I do that, I will attempt and try writing code for both the problems week 1 which is on Markov's chain proceess and then week 2 the maze solver.
